# pluto_moons
In this project we developed a python simulation of Pluto and its moons. We used the HORIZONS system from NASA as a reference on how our orbits should be. The result was pretty accurate after considering an approximation by spheric-harmonics for the potential. This considered some of the bodies used in the simulation as oblate objects instead of perfect spheres.

The models used were numbered from 1 to 4 for those that used the baricenter of Pluto's local system as the reference origin. However, these models showed a precession that got corrected when using the solar system's baricenter as the origin. Those models, 5 and 6, were done on a separate notebook.
