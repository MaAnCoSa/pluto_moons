# pluto_moons
In this project we developed a python simulation of Pluto and its moons. We used the HORIZONS system from NASA as a reference on how our orbits should be. The result was pretty accurate after considering an approximation by spheric-harmonics for the potential. This considered some of the bodies used in the simulation as oblate objects instead of perfect spheres.
